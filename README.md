# Introduction 

This API is part of test assignment for Tilde.

# Getting Started

1. Install PostgreSQL 16. Server use 'postgres' user and 'P@ssw0rd' password for connection to 'threadbox_api_dev' database.
1. Clone `tilde-test-assignment.api` repository. It is important to clone repository in the same directory as the `tilde-test-assignment.front`, since api-client.ts is generated by server to constant path.
1. Launch server using 'Tilde test assignment' profile and Debug configuration.

API specification is available at https://localhost:5000/api.
